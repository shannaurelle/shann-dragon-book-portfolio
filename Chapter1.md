# Introduction

When I was in eighth grade, I was learning how to code in C++/C. It was
something difficult when I started dipping myself into unfamiliar words.
Compile. Build. Run. I would type something on the keyboard, and being 
a diligent student I would be super obedient and follow the instructions
as stated in the book. I never know how memory works inside a computer,
nor I even know how does the computer "compile and build" a program I 
wrote. What we all needed to know, according to my teacher, was how I 
can order the computer to do what I want. I am often clueless, because
I really wanted to know more. I would sometimes code on weekends, tinkering
on how to do this "operator overloading" thing even if it was absolutely 
unnecessary in school. This was back in 2015, and that time I don't even know what Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow until I did a Google search. I only feared error messages
on the debugger and the interpreter, and my number one enemy is the term
"segmentation fault". Mind you I faced that disgusting term several times
in my life, owing to my inability to understand things beyond me like how
the operating system virtualizes the memory. If that is still unfamiliar 
to you, I highly suggest you take a pause, walk a little bit, and breathe.
You will need to learn computer organization, computer architecture, 
operating systems, along with computer programming languages like 
C and C++ to fully understand the rest of the writeups. The Dragon Book 
is so kind and direct to call it "computer science sophistication". I 
promise you, once you return after learning these things you will appreciate 
this portfolio.
