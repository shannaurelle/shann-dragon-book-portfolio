# Chapter 2

This is a summary for the syntax-directed translator. All code related to
the translator will be made in C, so unless you are not cool with it
and prefer a Java approach to it, you are free to consult the main reference.

I learned from this chapter how production rules from grammars can help
in creating a front-end for a compiler. Simple-translator in Chapter 2 folder
will show you how this transition starts. The program contains a parser which
accepts tokens such as integers and operators `+` and `-`.
