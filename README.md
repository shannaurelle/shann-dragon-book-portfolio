# Shann's Dragon Book Portfolio : A Self-paced Approach

## Foreword

This is my attempt at learning this book using the ultralearning approach.
The book specifies its contents to be good for six months in college, which
already includes essentials in compiler construction as well as optimizations.

My style of narrating this entire journey would be different. Rather than
simply telling all the content from the book, I would rather retell it 
from my own narrative. This may omit some details in the book, but I hope
it will convey my own true understanding of the subject.

This text may change over time. Commits can be tracked in the repository
and feel free to send me an issue if there's something I overlooked. If you
have any questions aside from the content I learned from the Dragon Book, 
feel free to contact me through email at shannaurelleg@gmail.com.
