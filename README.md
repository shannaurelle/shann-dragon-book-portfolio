# Shann's Dragon Book Portfolio : A Self-paced Approach

## Foreword

This is my attempt at learning compiler design and construction 
using the ultralearning approach with the Book Compilers: Principles,
Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition). The book specifies its contents 
to be good for six months in college, which already includes the essentials 
in compiler construction as well as optimizations. However, my attempt will 
do it (hopefully) in three months or less, and that will also include 
writing on this repository, video lecture documentation embed, and other 
relevant visual aids if necessary.

My style of narrating this entire journey would be different. Rather than
simply telling all the content from the book, I would rather tell it 
from my own narrative. This may omit some details in the book, but I hope
it will convey my own understanding of the subject.

This text may change over time. Commits can be tracked in the repository
and feel free to send me an issue if there's something I overlooked. If you
have any questions aside from the content I learned from the Dragon Book, 
feel free to contact me through email at shannaurelleg@gmail.com.
